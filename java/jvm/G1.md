# G1 Garbage Collector Phases Overview

## GC Phases Summary

| Phase                | STW  | Trigger Condition               | Duration      | Description |
|----------------------|------|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Young GC**         | ✅   | Eden zone full                 | 10-200ms      | Collects young generation (Eden+Survivor), promotes surviving objects |
| **Initial Mark**     | ✅   | Old gen > 45% occupied         | <1ms          | Starts concurrent marking cycle (piggybacks on Young GC) |
| **Concurrent Mark**  | ❌   | After Initial Mark             | 10ms-10s      | Concurrently marks live objects throughout heap |
| **Remark**          | ✅   | After Concurrent Mark          | 5-50ms        | Finalizes marking with STW pause |
| **Mixed GC**        | ✅   | After marking completes        | Like Young GC | Collects young gen + most garbage-heavy old gen regions |
| **Full GC**         | ✅   | Allocation/ Promotion failure  | Seconds       | Falls back to serial collector (should be avoided) |
